# GraphQL Using the Apollo Framework: Getting Started

![Poster](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/ApolloGraphQL-feature.png)

GraphQL is a data query language that simplifies client-server interactions over conventional REST or ad-hoc systems. 

It was opened to the community at large in 2015, and since then, has rapidly gained traction, standardizing the process of defining and delivering data to mobile and web apps alike.

The increasing popularity of GraphQL created a thriving, open-source community focused on everything from client libraries to IDE tools. One of the most popular of these projects is Apollo, a type-safe, caching GraphQL implementation available on a number of platforms.

The Apollo Framework makes it simple to consume a GraphQL schema, auto-generate data models, fetch and mutate data for any GraphQL endpoint, all on the client platform of your choice.
